### Tools
- deno std library
- typescript

### Requirements
- deno @v0.35.0

### Usage
**Note**: Be advised that this package is not yet published to the deno 3rd party repository as it still needs some refactoring and testing before release.

However, you can clone this repository and run the make command `make init arg=rw`. Make sure you have deno installed.

**Note**: Due to the current release status of deno, the package guarantees support for v0.35.0. This will consistently be updated with subsequent releases.
